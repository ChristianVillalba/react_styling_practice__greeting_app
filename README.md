## Description
This project displays a greeting message depending on the hour: 
* Good Moring!  
  * Between 00:00 and 11:59
  * In red
* Good Evening!
  * Between 12:00 and 17:59
  * In green
* Good Night!
  * between 18:00 and 23:59
  * In blue

## What I have learned with this project:
* Styling Elements
* Get the current time using JavaScript
* Use an If Statement to render Elements depending on certain conditions
  * The greeting message will change depending on the hour
* Use Inline Styling to to update styles on the fly
  * The color of the greeting message will change depending on the hour
